- 👋 Hi, I’m @Uzma <br>
- 👀 I’m interested and passionate about technology, innovation and big challenging tasks on my to-do list. <br>
     That makes me want to learn more and keep up with building something greater than me. <br>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML| Css |JavaScript & Typescript  <br>
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate to help new developers find people (both experienced or also learning) <br>
     to work on projects that they are mutually interested in. <br>
- 📫 How to reach me ... <br>
- 😄 Pronouns: ...her/she <br>
- ⚡ Fun fact: “An interesting fact about me is that I love participating in hackathons. <br>
    Hackathons push me to think on my feet and quickly implement solutions under pressure. <br>
    I enjoy the thrill of turning ideas into functional prototypes. This experience translates directly into <br>
    my ability to handle tight deadlines and deliver quality code efficiently in my day-to-day work.”
