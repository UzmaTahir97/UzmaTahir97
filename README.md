    <ul>
        <li>👀 I’m interested and passionate about technology, innovation and big challenging tasks on my to-do list.
  That makes me want to learn more and keep up with building something greater than me.</li>
        <li>🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript & TypeScript.</li>
        <li>💞️ I’m looking to collaborate to help new developers find people (both experienced or also learning) 
 to work on projects that they are mutually interested in.</li>
        <li>😄 Pronouns: her/she.</li>
        <li>How you reach me:devUzma97@gmail.com</li>
        <li>⚡ Fun fact: “An interesting fact about me is that I love participating in hackathons. 
 Hackathons push me to think on my feet and quickly implement solutions under pressure. 
 I enjoy the thrill of turning ideas into functional prototypes. This experience translates directly into 
  my ability to handle tight deadlines and deliver quality code efficiently in my day-to-day work.”</li>
    </ul>
